Using this as my personal code stash

I've been working 17+ years at KeplerERP, so mostly I'll be sharing some utility "kpl pages" that might be interesting in implementations, that are not part of the official ERP Release.

* __Where can I find more information about "KeplerERP"?__ [Here ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½](https://kepler.com.mx/erp-kepler/) and [Here ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸](https://ekepler.com/)
* __What are "kpl pages"?__ The kernel of the ERP is developed in C++, and is a closed source project (I'm one of the very few kernel developers). But since the main feature of the product is "flexibility", we developed a proprietary script language "CK", and a container "page" to describe the graphic elements and functionality of every single page of the system since version 8.0. These pages can be created/modified by ERP consultants and by the IT department of the companies that implement this ERP Software. Even create whole new modules and [plugins](https://kepler.com.mx/plugins)

* Technologies I enjoy working with:
  - C++11
  - Visual Studio
  - Qt framework
  - SQLAPI library
  - Kepler ERP
  - SQL
  - PostgreSql
  - MSSQL
