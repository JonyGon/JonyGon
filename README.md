Using this as my personal code stash

I've been working 19+ years at KeplerERP, so mostly I'll be sharing some utility "kpl pages" that might be interesting in implementations, that are not part of the official ERP Release.

* __Where can I find more information about "KeplerERP"?__ [Here ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½](https://kepler.com.mx/erp-kepler/) and [Here ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸](https://ekepler.com/)
* __What are "kpl pages"?__ The kernel of the ERP is developed in C++, and is a closed source project (I'm one of the very few kernel developers). But since the main feature of the product is "flexibility", we developed a proprietary script language "CK", and a container "page" to describe the graphic elements and functionality of every single page of the system since version 8.0. These pages can be created/modified by ERP consultants and by the IT department of the companies that implement this ERP Software. Even create whole new modules and [plugins](https://kepler.com.mx/plugins). (I've contributed several plugins myself.) 

* Technologies I enjoy working with:
  - C++11 and up
  - Visual Studio
  - Qt framework
  - SQLAPI library
  - Kepler ERP
  - SQL
  - PostgreSql
  - MSSQL

* About me:  
  I'm a Computer Systems Engineer with an MBA, and have been the Tech lead @KeplerERP since 2011, company where I've developed my entire professional career

* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:  
  - Kepler v9.5
  - Porting main ERP client desktop app to a full featured web app.
   
* Recent projects:  
  In 2022, I read the "Eloquent JavaScript" book to update my JavaScript knowledge, specially after ECMAScript 2015. Really enjoyed it, and then with this knowledge I built a proof of conecept Node.JS specialized web server as a supporting server-side JS Backend that allowed Kepler Server to use JavaScript, Node and its modules. I has been already been integrated into the official release, and has replaced the previuos "mail sender" module, to use "Nodemailer". We are planning on building a Server side PDF module, and also a Chart creation module with this technology. 


* ðŸŒ± Next technology to look into: React, just to see what all the fuss is about ðŸ¤“
